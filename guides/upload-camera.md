Traditionally, getting photos off of a digital camera is a tedious process.
_Remove the SD card, plug it in, copy the files to disk,
eject the volume, put the SD card back in the camera_‚Äînot
an easy thing for a busy person to do every time they take some photos.

We can‚Äôt automate _all_ of these steps away, but with this guide,
you can at least eliminate the mouse/keyboard interaction:
_remove the SD card, plug it in, let it run, put it back._

(There are, of course, other ways to do something similar‚Äîeither
using photo management software or with a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth-enabled camera‚Äîbut
this is what works best for me.)

Conceptual Overview
-------------------

In broad strokes, we will set up a **user-level systemd service**
that waits for the camera or SD card to be attached
before mounting it, moving its contents to Xferase‚Äôs inbox, and unmounting it.

Because this is a user-level service,
we need to **add an fstab entry for the camera or SD card**
so that it can be mounted by a regular user (_i.e.,_ without `sudo`).

If all of that made sense to you, skip ahead to [Step 1][] below.
If not, here are some questions you might be asking yourself right now:

> #### ü§î **What is a ‚Äúuser-level‚Äù service?**
>
> Most systemd units are ‚Äúsystem-level‚Äù, meaning that they are run as root.
> As you might expect, user-level units are run as the user they belong to.

> #### ü§î **Why do we need a user-level service?**
>
> We are going to write a custom service
> to copy files from one place to another.
> We can‚Äôt use a system-level service because if we did,
> the resulting files (_i.e.,_ our personal photo library)
> would be owned by `root`. üôÖ
>
> #### ü§î **What is fstab?**
>
> _fstab_ (short for ‚Äúfilesystem table‚Äù) is a system configuration file
> detailing rules for how to mount individual storage devices.
> We will use it to hardcode a rule
> allowing regular users to mount your camera‚Äôs SD card,
> along with specifying what directory it should be mounted to:
>
> ```sh
> # Instead of this...

> # ...you‚Äôll be able to do this
> $ mount /media/camera

Step 1: Allow regular users to mount the camera (via fstab)
-----------------------------------------------------------

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**

> The examples below are taken from the author‚Äôs own system and camera;

```sh
# Create a permanent mount point
$ sudo mkdir /media/ricoh_gr

# Plug your camera into USB, then find its LABEL or UUID
$ sudo blkid
/dev/sda1: UUID="9d5c5dfb-87d9-0dc7-ab96-658bf52e93bf" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="7bcbc41d-cfff-874c-a825-e9041357d15e"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="6364-D4D0" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="7568cf1f-66b6-4875-9f0e-31be907c3bda"
/dev/sdb2: UUID="dec5c1ad-b8cb-4c2f-c798-e169d11fc29e" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="e3f86e17-96a7-4eec-ba49-83a7a0cd1a2e"

/dev/sdc1: LABEL_FATBOOT="RICOH_GR" LABEL="RICOH_GR" TYPE="vfat"
                                         # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è There it is!

# Add an entry for it to your /etc/fstab
$ sudo -e /etc/fstab

    # <file system>		<mount point>	<type>	<options>		<dump>	<pass>
    LABEL=RICOH_GR		/media/ricoh_gr	vfat	defaults,noauto,user	0	2

# Verify that it works üéâüéâüéâ
$ mount /media/ricoh_gr
```

Step 2: Create your systemd service
-----------------------------------

```sh
# Find the name for your camera‚Äôs systemd device unit by label or UUID
$ systemctl --all --full --type=device | grep -E '(label|uuid)' | awk '{print $1}'

dev-disk-by\x2dlabel-RICOH_GR.device # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è There it is!

# Create the service file
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/systemd/user
$ vim ~/.local/share/systemd/user/dcim-transfer.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Digital Photo Transfer for Ricoh GR
    BindsTo=dev-disk-by\x2dlabel-RICOH_GR.device
    After=dev-disk-by\x2dlabel-RICOH_GR.device

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'mount /media/ricoh_gr && find /media/ricoh_gr/DCIM -type f -exec mv -t /path/to/xferase/inbox "{}" + && find /media/ricoh_gr/DCIM/ -type d | tac | xargs rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty "{}" + && umount /media/ricoh_gr'
    Restart=no

    [Install]
    WantedBy=dev-disk-by\x2dlabel-RICOH_GR.device

# Reload to pick up your changes
$ systemctl --user daemon-reload

# Take a photo, plug in your camera, and run manually verify that it works
$ systemctl --user start dcim-transfer

# ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù it to run automatically each time your camera is plugged in üéâüéâüéâ
$ systemctl --user enable dcim-transfer
```

> ü§î **Note:** Why do we use `find -exec mv ...` and not `mv ...`?
>
> Xferase watches for changes in the inbox using inotify.
> inotify cannot watch directories recursively,
> so new files have to be placed inside the inbox directly.

Now, you should be able to
take some photos, plug in your camera, and just walk away‚Äîand
the photos should automatically appear in Xferase‚Äôs inbox. ü•Ç
